## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and Principal Investigator at the Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour.(Max-Planck-Gesellschaft)

**Published in, when?**

  * on Science daily (6 july 2020)

**General topic**

1. Animals behave unusually before an earthquake.So there is a study on their animal behavior before seismic tremor.

    * The animals had unusual behaviour before a quake -> very restless. 

2. The scientists attached sensor to the animals to detect their movements during several months.

  => The objective is to anticipate an impending earthquake through animal movements.

**Procedure, what was examined**

* Firstly, the different animals (cow, sheep and dog) had a collar during several months (1800 quakes, 12 strong quakes ). 

* Secondly, the study was in comparison on different factors (= the size, the speed, the species,...)

**Conclusion or discovery**

* the unusual behaviour is a sign of 20 hours before seismic tremors. 

* The nearer animals are to earthquake, the faster their behaviour changes.

**Remaining questions**

* a new project = observe more animals at long term in earthquake of area (system Icarus on the International Space Station (ISS)). 

* A another remaining question : "how animals can sense impending earthquakes?"
    * Several hypothesis exist: smell the quartz of gas / feel the pressure strong of the rocks.
