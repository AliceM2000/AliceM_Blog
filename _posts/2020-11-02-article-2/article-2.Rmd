## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * University of Plymouth, University of Roehampton, SRUC, and Newcastle University.
  
**Published in, when?**

  * Journal of the Royal Society Interface (9 june 2020)
  
**General topic**
  
  * method easy and low-cost -> listening to chick = resolve welfare problem as soon as possible
  
  * nature: loud and distinctive chick's distress cry above other noises.
  
    * causes discomfort in the environment or other.
  
**Procedure, what was examined**

  * acoustic recording = 12 typical flocks of 25,000 chicks
  
  * the first day: all chicks cry ->  a new strange environment. After , the cry chicks less (accustomed by the environment).
  
    * tool use at the right time (simple intervention for animals welfare) => use early in life,bring an improvement
    
    * work not additional to the farmer.
    
  * method study: Soundscape (sound more tonic at the chicks) -> alarm precocious to the farmer
  
**Conclusion or discovery**

  * advantage for surveillance (danger alarm)
  
  * improve welfare behavioral and emotional animal centric
