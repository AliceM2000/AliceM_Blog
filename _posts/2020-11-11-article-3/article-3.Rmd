## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Radolfzell (Max-Planck-Gesellschaft)

**Published in, When?**

  * On Nature Ecology & Evolution (22 June 2020)

**General topic**

  * In whole world, lockdown -> reduced human mobility. so new information on the relation between wildlife and human.
  * a lot of publication on social network -> a unusual meeting with wildlife
    * especially in region metropolitain, more animals that habit but too unusual visitor (puma in the city center and dolphin in the port)
    * for another animals, it is very difficult
      * in the city, gull or rat or monkey -> running out of food
      * in more remote area, more poaching and persecution

**Procedure, what was examined**

  * a wide variety of animals (fish, bird and mammal). the objective = make a global table effects of confinement.
  * Researcher studied movement, behavior and stress level animals before, during and after lockdown through bio-loggers.
  * everywhere in the world, the biologist -> track animals by miniature devices.
  * More 200 data together to analyze.

**Conclusion or discovery**

  * improve our comprehension interaction human and wildlife
  * possible study = the movement of animals in modern landscapes -> affect per human presence or its building.

**Remaining question**

  * unforeseen opportunities to forge a mutually beneficial coexistence with other species
  * environment well, essential own well-being
