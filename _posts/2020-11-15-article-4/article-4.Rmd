## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * the Universities of Sussex and Portsmouth

**Published in, when?**

  * in the Nature journal Scientific Reports (7 october 2020)

**General topic**

  * creation a bond with cats thanks to an eye narrowing technique with them
  
    * for a cats, an eye narrowing = a genuine smile (a positive situation for another species)
    
  * known means of communication:
  
    * the purring attract, recognize their name (cats), sensitive emotional signals

  * advantage more communication: 
    
    * improve the public understanding of cats, improve cats welfare, more about their socio-cognitive abilities .

**Procedure, what was examined**

 * the meaning of the slow blink in cat-human communication
 
1. 21 cats from 14 different households, 10 cats male and 11 cats female, age between 0,45 and 16 years.
  
    * the cat's owner on slow blink.
    * Cat's settling up at the same place -> the owner approximately 1 m away from the cat
    
2. 24 extra cats from 8 different household, 12 cats male and 12 cats female, age between 1 and 17 years.
  
    * Researchers (cats don't know) with slow blink
    * Researchers (cats don't know) without slow blink
    
 => This experiment also test -> the cats approach the unfamiliar experimenter = a flat hand with palm faced upwards to offer the cat . 

**Conclusion or discovery**

  * if human make slow blink and slow down the eyes -> more the cats approach you (one more form of communication)
  
  * the cats also -> a slow blink and slow down the eyes

**Remaining questions**

  * study not easy natural cat behaviour
  
  * the next studies = assess the welfare of cats in veterinary practices or shelters
