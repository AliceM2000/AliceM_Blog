## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * The University of Maryland

**Published in, when?**

  * In journal Science (6 november 2020)

**General topic**

  * Biologist -> a data archive of animal movement studies in relation to climate change
  
    * from across the global Arctic and sub-Arctic (most affected by global warming)
    
  * 3 studies -> show surprising trends and associations between climate change and animal behavior
  
    * animals study -> golden eagles, bears, caribou, moose and wolves

**Procedure, what was examined**

  * difficult to study general tendency of animal behavior
   
    * Cause :
      
      -> animal ecology not studied in landscapes (cover entire regions on earth) 
      
      -> data needed in various organizations and jurisdictions (not available and not standardized)
    
    * Solution : creation of a relationship with scientists from national governments, regions and first nations and research groups from all over the Arctic
    
      -> global repository = Arctic Animal Movement Archive (AAMA)
      
      -> more than 100 universities, government agencies and groups conversation of 17 countries
  
  * Data from 201 monitoring studies of terrestrial and marine animals (8000 animals between 1991 and today)
  
  * First study = movement of 900 female caribou from 2000 to 2017 (University of Mayland)
  
  * Second study = movement of over 100 golden eagles from 1993 to 2017 (University Columbia)
  
  * Third study = examine the speed of movement of bears, caribou, moose and wolves from 1998 to 2019 (University Washington)
  
  * analysis tools -> the same for each of the studies

**Conclusion or discovery**

  * Result of the first study :
    
    * Migratory caribou -> give birth earlier in the spring (depending on the rate of warming)
    
    * Non-migratory caribou -> only the northern subpopulations = same as the migrants
    
    => give birth earlier -> grow during the summer season but don't have time to reach the optimal calving grounds
  
  * Result of the second study :
  
    * immature birds -> migrating north in the spring arrived earlier following mild winters (not adult birds)
    
    => The timing shift for young birds -> response to climate change,
    age-related behavior changes ->only through decades of movement data 
  
  * Result of the third study :
  
    * species -> react differently to seasonal temperature and winter snow conditions 
    
    => Those differences -> influence species interactions, food competition and predator-prey dynamics.

**Remaining questions**

  * Other scientists continue to use AAMA -> Answer to questions about the reaction of animals to the evolution of the Arctic side
  
  * AAMA continue to have more and more data
  
  * essential to understand their behavior to predict their reaction to global warming.
