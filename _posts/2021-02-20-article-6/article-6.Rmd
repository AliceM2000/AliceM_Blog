## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * The University of Exeter

**Published in, when?**

  * In Jounal Birds (5 February 2021)

**General topic**

  * Bird species (living in their natural habitats) -> learn at the zoo to manage animals in captivity
  
    * help guide and develop conservation actions for living in the wild (animals in captivity)
  
  * Bird -> group + diverse but not studied in zoos
  
    * wild bird research -> useful because improve bird management in zoos
    
  * For species adapts poorly, zoo professionals -> relationship with field biologists
    
    * to share information (the best way to take care of these species in captivity + how to develop) and the actions to be taken
    
      * use proxy species (common in zoos) -> to develop conservation practices for less familiar species (
in difficulty of adaptation)
      
      * Promote species threats -> not be part of the zoo using the most common species.

**Procedure, what was examined**

1. hornbill = a species of bird that is essential to the long viability and sustainability of biodiversity in the rainforest
  
    * The helmeted hornbill = endangered , an important role in the dispersal of seeds within pristine, undisturbed areas of south-east Asian rainforests.
    
    * The population decline of the helmeted hornbill = caused by poaching of the birds for their "ivory," the large casque on the bird's head and bill ( 10% of its overall body mass)
    
2. Guam kingfishers = a species -> be extinct in the wild and reliant on captive breeding for its survival.

    * Data ( nesting locations of the closely related Pohnpei kingfisher) -> on a neighbouring island,temperatures hotter than for captive Guam kingfishers.
    
    * The findings = zoos raising the temperature to improve nesting success amongst the species

**Conclusion or discovery**

  * the ecological role of the helmeted hornbill in its natural habitat
    
    * zoos = able to design enclosures -> increase chances of reproduction
      
      * by identifying the temperature and humidity range of hornbill nesting sites in the wild -> more likely to hatch eggs (these environmental conditions as closely as possible)
      
  * Zoos ->guide conservation action for hornbills living in the wild by monitoring the behaviour of these birds
    
    * using nest boxes improve the quality of habitats for hornbills ( to breed in) -> these boxes being = in areas of the helmeted hornbill's range in Borneo

**Remaining questions**

  * The effect of visitors on zoos :
    
    * help guide future research questions
    
    * improve understanding of birds in human care
    
  * Developing zoo bird exhibits 
    
    * promote wider understanding of the threats (by wild birds specifically)
    
    * encourage human behaviour change (benefits ecosystem health)
