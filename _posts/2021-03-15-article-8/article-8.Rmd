## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg (MLU) and the University of Bayreuth 

**Published in, when?**

  * in the journal eLife (03 November 2020)

**General topic**

  * Ants -> use their own acid 
  
    * to disinfect themselves and their stomachs
      
      * kill harmful bacteria in food
      
      * improve the intestinal flora of the ant
      
    * formic acid = one of the simplest organic acids (produced in a special gland in the abdomen for many ants)

**Procedure, what was examined**

  * long-standing hypothesis -> acid purpose to ward off predators 
    
    * add in hypothesis -> also use for brood care
    
  * new study on ant -> swallowing food or water after cleaning the hindquarters
  

**Conclusion or discovery**

  * not linked to digestion -> do this even after ingesting only water
  
  * several experiments -> internal disinfection of the ant by itself
    
    * with acid -> chance of survival increases
    
    * transmit their food with acid to their partner -> decrease risk of disease
    
   => this behavior -> decrease in germ propagation in an ant colony
   
  * some ant -> less bacteria in digestive tract (except acid-resistant microbes)
  
    * acid = filter mechanism (organizes the ant microbiome)
    
    * extremely acidic ant stomach (rare in animals)
  
**Remaining questions**

  * a mystery still for the precise functioning of formic acid
