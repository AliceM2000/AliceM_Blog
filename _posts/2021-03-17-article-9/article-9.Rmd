## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * the University of Exeter and WWT Slimbridge Wetland Centre

**Published in, when?**

  * On Ethology (08 June 2020)

**General topic**

  * Bright pink flamingos -> more aggressive than paler rivals (fighting over food)
  
  * Pink plumage = a sign of good health in lesser flamingos
  
    * a flush of colour = ready to breed.
    
  * the birds squabble over food
    
    => the pinkest flamingos (male and female) ->tend to push the others.
    
  * Flamingos = large group with social structures
  
    * color significant impact (color due to carotenoid in food)
    
  * A healthy flamingo (an efficient feeder), colourful feathers 
    
    * more time and energy to be aggressive and dominant when feeding

**Procedure, what was examined**

  * lesser flamingos -> weigh 2 kg and native to Africa (bird in captivity for study)
  
  * study 1 pale pink flamingo out of 4 brilliant pink flamingo
  
  * different situation study their behavior (lesser flamingos) :
  
    * in indoor feed bowl
    * large indoor feed pool
    * outdoors with large feed pool

**Conclusion or discovery**

  * results: 
  
    * in the pool outside, bird -> the time for searching for food = 2 times longer than for aggressiveness
  
    * food closer, bicker more and seek food less
  
  * as wide area as possible in zoos
  
  * zoos don't need big change -> but necessary for animal welfare
  
  * no influence between male and female in rate of feeding or aggression
  
**Remaining questions**

  * encourage research on natural food and reduce aggressions as much as possible
