## Analysis about study

**Researches?**

  * the Universities of Exeter and Plymouth

**Published in, when?**

  * in Ecology & Evolution (10 November 2020)

**General topic**

  * Before one-on-one fights, animals -> to make decisions based on factors 
    
    * the size and strength of the opponent, the outcome of recent fights and the importance of the prize
    
  * previous research -> often overlook the complexity of group conflicts 
    
    * assuming a larger group wins
    
    * according to them, factors = group cohesion and teamwork, strength of individual members and place of battle + group of animals assess before fighting
    
  * For any fight (man or animals) -> + complex with several individuals on each side
    
    * groups -> assess the importance 
      
      * why fight and certain factors in relation to the group and opponent

**Procedure, what was examined**

  * research on dyadic combat -> advanced framework on evaluation
  
    * example : how animals -> information and decision to fight
    
  * study on group competitions in animals living in society -> not focus on evaluation
  
    * benefit for evolution and conflict in humans
    
    * conflicts between social groups = common nature
  

**Conclusion or discovery**

  * numbers of a normally winning group but other factor also influencing: 
  
    * Strong individuals : For gray wolves, a smaller group with more male (stronger and larger) -> defeat larger group
    
    * Motivation : for meerkat group -> defend and expand territory (+ food) for the little ones -> win even with lower number

    * Chances of winning : for turtle ants -> defense to certain area in their territory (often narrow entrances)
    
    * "Winner/loser effect" : for baboons, losers of intergroup conflicts -> - of time in combat zones
    
    * Social cohesion : for chimpanzees -> + cohesive and + male (- aggressive) during the months of frequent inter-group fights

  * many other example in the animal kingdom -> individuals work together
  
**Remaining questions**

  * researcher -> ask to what extent combat animals use evaluation
