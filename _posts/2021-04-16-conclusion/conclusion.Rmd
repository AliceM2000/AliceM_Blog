According to the different article we can observe that animal behaviours has a lot of impact on different factor. 


Some animals can warn in advance to a earthquake. Chick can insure their welfare and also give alert of imminent danger thanks to their cry. Human impact on animal behaviours is big on the presence of human or their building. Cats have capacity to communicate by way of their eyes with their master or between them. Climate change has a lot of the impact on migration and birth from different species. Wild birds improve living environment for the well-being of animals in captivity. The choice of flowers for honey bees and bumblebees are different in comparison to their need. Ants ingest their own acid for their welfare. Pinkers flamingos are aggressive one towards the other if and only if  their food is too close.  Many factors influence to encourage a species or a group of species to fight.


But a lot of question remain unresolved. Why animals have such behaviours? Can they have a big impact on our future? What other behaviour can other animals have even known or unknown?
